### Explore the full tutorial

For a more detailed tutorial on this topic, you can follow the [Build a co-pilot using the Azure AI SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azureai-insiders/blob/aistudio-preview/previews/aistudio/tutorials/copilot_with_sdk.md) tutorial.

### Customize the development container

You can pip install packages into your development environment but they will disappear if you rebuild your container and need to be reinstalled (re-build is not automatic). You may want this, so that you can easily reset back to a clean environment. Or, you may want to install some packages by default into the container so that you don't need to re-install packages after a rebuild.

To add packages into the default container, you can update the Dockerfile in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, and then rebuild the development container from the command palette by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` and selecting the `Rebuild container` command.
