# 08 | Deploy Your Copilot

## Step 6: Deploy the copilot to Azure

The final step of our journey is to _deploy_ our copilot implementation to an online endpoint on Azure, so that it can be used by your users and applications.

> [!NOTE]  
> There is ongoing work to support a deploy capability from the Azure AI SDK and Azure AI CLI but this has not been tested in this sample. We will update this tutorial when this is available.

In the meantime, please refer to the following documentation links to learn more about deployment options and try a simple tutorial to deploy a chat web app _from Azure AI Studio_.

 - [Tutorial: Deploy a chat web app](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/deploy-chat-web-app#deploy-your-web-app) - on your data.
 - [Deployments Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/deployments-overview) - on Azure AI Studio
