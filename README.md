## üîé | Explore Azure AI Studio Features

This repository contains a copilot quickstart sample that can be used with the [Azure AI Studio preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio). Explore these resources to learn more about this supports:

* [Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio) - build, evaluate & deploy AI solutions from one space.
* [Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services) - AI models & APIs accessible from Azure AI Studio.
* [Azure AI SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/sdk-install) - access to Azure AI services from code (programmatic).
* [Azure AI CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/cli-install) - access to Azure AI services from command-line (shell).


## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª | Build a copilot with your own data

The sample walks through creating a copilot enterprise chat API that uses custom Python code to ground the copilot responses in your company data and APIs. The sample is meant to provide a starting point that you can further customize to add additional intelligence or capabilities. Following the steps in the [**sample tutorial**](docs/start.md), you will be able to:
 - setup your development environment (pre-built or custom options)
 - create Azure AI resources and project to build the copilot
 - create an Azure Search index containing product information
 - run your copilot with a sample question, and evaluate it

In the process, you will get familiar with the **Azure AI CLI** for setting up and configuring your copilot from the commandline. And you'll learn to use the **Azure AI SDK** (from Python code or from Jupyter Notebooks) to interact programmatically with your copilot.

> [!NOTE]  
> We do not guarantee the quality of responses produced by this sample copilot or its suitability for use in your scenario, and responses will vary as development of this sample is ongoing. You must perform your own validation the outputs of the copilot and its suitability for use within your company.
