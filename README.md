## Goal: Build a copilot with your own data

Learn to build your own copilot using the Azure AI Studio with core resources (Azure AI Services) and tools (Azure AI SDK, Azure AI CLI). The tutorial guides you through the following steps:

1. Setup and validate your development environment.
2. Create an Azure AI project and AI resources for your copilot.
3. Create an Azure AI search index for your custom data.
4. Validate copilot by asking a question about your custom data.
5. Evaluate the performance of your copilot implementation.
6. (Optional) Deploy the copilot to Azure and invoke it.

## Pre-Requisites

1. Azure account with active subscription.
2. GitHub account with access to GitHub Codespaces.
3. (Optional) Set of docs that represent "your custom data".

Ensure that you have [access to the Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/faq#how-can-customers-access-azure-ai-studio--) in your region, and can access related resources in your subscription. Refer to the [Azure AI Studio FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/faq#how-can-customers-access-azure-ai-studio--) for more details on regional availability, pricing and more.
